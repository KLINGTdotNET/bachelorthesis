# API Design

"Matt Gemmell" - API are UX for Developers.

1. intuitiv
2. reibungslos
3. nachsichtig

Default set of principles as when you're creating UIs. Most commonly needed stuff has to be easy, without undue configuration.

# Joshua Bloch

Most API designers are over-constrained
"You won't be able to please everyone" --> "Aim to displease everyone equally"
"When in doubt, leave it out" --> "You can never remove, but always add"
