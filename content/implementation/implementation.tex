DOM-Parser vs. Streaming-Parser und Mittelding (StAX)

\thesisquote{
Streaming pull parsing refers to a programming model in which a client application calls methods on an XML parsing library when it needs to interact with an XML infoset—that is, the client only gets (pulls) XML data when it explicitly asks for it.
Streaming push parsing refers to a programming model in which an XML parser sends (pushes) XML data to the client as the parser encounters elements in an XML infoset—that is, the parser sends the data whether or not the client is ready to use it at that time.
