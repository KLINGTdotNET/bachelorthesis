# Bachelor Thesis

This repository contains all the files that i used to create my bachelor thesis. The tesis is written in `(Xe-)LaTeX`, with help of `biber` and `makeglossaries`.

## Requirements
To build this document you need the following two packages (tested under Linux Mint 15 and Ubuntu 13.04, Fedora 18+ works also, but there is no biber package):
    
    -   `sudo apt-get install -y texlive-full biber`
